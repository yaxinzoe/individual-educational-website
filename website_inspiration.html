                    The inspiration for the website content comes from the wonderful night of the Museum of Picture and Fiction, which tells us about Hector, a night watchman at the Museum of Natural History in New York. On his first night at work, he woke up to find that all the dinosaur bones had disappeared. 
                    He couldn't find anything around the museum, Central Park and the next astronomical museum. Ultimately, Hector found that dinosaurs became alive every night.
                    After interesting and moved things happening, he decided to keep the outside world away from the inside dinosaurs instead of keeping the museum away from the outside world(Milan, 1993).

                    The site combines picture stories with navigation history, telling the story of the night watchman who found a ship remains and a navigation map in the museum and was trapped in the vessel by accident.
                    The user's task is to control the ship's course by clicking on different icons on the nautical map while learning the nautical history, local geographical features and customs and culture of the place whenever he arrives at a destination.
                    Ultimately, all the destinations were completed and quickly tested. Users who answered all the questions correctly could rescue the night watchman.
