                        <p>The Victoria sailboat crossed the Indian Ocean, the Cape of Good Hope, the Cape Verde Islands, and returned to Spain on September 6, 1522. 
                        It took 1082 days to complete the first human round-the-world voyage. Magellan route is 60 440 kilometers long.
                        Magellan's fleet succeeded in sailing around the world at a tremendous cost, proving that the earth is spherical and that the oceans of all parts of the world are united. For this reason, people call Magellan the first person to embrace the earth. </p>

                        <p>On October 21, 1520, the expedition fleet sailed south along the coast of South America and found a strait leading to the Pacific Ocean. 
                        In memory of Magellan, later generations called this Strait Magellan Strait. In 1521, the Magellan fleet crossed the Pacific Ocean 
                        and arrived at Humunu Island in the Philippine Islands. Magellan wanted to conquer the island and make it a Spanish colony. 
                        But he was killed by local residents during the fighting. After Magellan's death, his men continued Magellan's unfinished voyage.  </p>

                        Then he crossed the Atlantic Ocean and sailed for four months to the coast of South America and Brazil. Meanwhile, when they passed through a quiet bay, Magellan named it as Port San Julian .</p>

                        <p>Most people in Europe in the 15th century believed that the earth was flat and that the ocean ended in an abyss. 
                        Magellan was a believer in the theory of earth circle. In 1517, he proposed to Portugal a plan to sail around the world, but it was not supported.
                        In order to gain more wealth, the King of Spain is trying to develop overseas. Thus the King of Spain supported Magellan in his navigational expeditions and equipped Magellan with a fleet of expeditions. 
                        At this point, Magellan's voyage around the world began. </p>
