                <p id="font-size">
                    The website is to use an interesting way to introduce the history and related geography knowledge about the Magellan who made a voyage around the world in the 16th century .
                    Magellanâ€™s global voyage is a significant discovery in the history of world marine navigation as it proved that earth is a globular when most Europeans believed that the globe is flat in the middle century.
                    Ferdinand Magellan took part in the voyage to India, Africa, Indonesia, finding a route from Europe which leads to a Spice Islands of Indonesia and after he was killed by native Filipinos, the remaining crew reached Spain(Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,1967).
                    However, the two-thirds crew was died due to the scurvy during the voyage(Leonard J & Walter H.C, 2014).

                    Moreover, it is not easy for young children to travel abroad due to their age so that they have strong desires to know the exotic culture.
                    Junior school students need to learn this part of knowledge in their courses and they are easily attracted by the way to introduce geography or history since it is interesting enough to absorb knowledge.
